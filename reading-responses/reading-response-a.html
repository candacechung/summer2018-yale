      "Which is to say I’m not a natural. I love computers, but they never made any sense
      to me. And yet, after two decades of jamming information into my code-resistant brain,
      I’ve amassed enough knowledge that the computer has revealed itself. Its magic has
      been stripped away. I can talk to someone who used to work at Amazon.com or
      Microsoft about his or her work without feeling a burning shame. I’d happily talk to
      people from Google and Apple, too, but they so rarely reenter the general population."

      I love learning languages, it allows me to communicate with people around the world,
      learn about their culture. There has been a lot of different languages dominating in the
      world, English, French, Chinese, etc. Apart from the spoken languages with a long history
      in the human world, languages used in the digital world, are becoming more trending
      nowadays. Computer science has always appeared to be the hardest thing for me to pick up,
      espcially programming languages. I have had a few basic programming lessons back in
      junior high school. It was fine, as we were just copying the codes from the lecture notes,
      not much thinking is required. Until 2 years ago, when I was in college, I met a friend
      who is so proficient in programming, and got very good result from the course. Under
      persuadsion, I took that course in the following semester, and it was a total disaster
      that I have completely lost faith in the learning programming languages, even though I
      know it could bring me to a whole new world once I managed to understand it. I started
      to doubt that maybe I am not those who are born to be good at computer science, unlike my
      friend. And maybe I should give up learning computer science. Yet, when I was
      choosing what courses to take during this summer session, this course Introduction to
      Interactive Design: World Wide Web raised my interest in this field again, I really wish
      it could help me to reopen the door to the digital world. As time goes by, I started to
      gain more interest, as well as understanding in the programming languages. I am so glad I
      am really making progress in this aspect.
      When I was reading 'What is Code', this passage evokes my resonance, it makes me feel that
      I am not the only one who are not born to be good at comprehending programming languages,
      and it is totally fine to be so. From time to time, as we read and work more with it, I
      stated to gain more confidence in it and the computer somehow started to reveal itself to
      me bits by bits. I think I am somehow experiecning the similar stage as Paul did, though they
      are in a completely different level. Though there are still quite a lot of difficulties during
      the learning and the practices, I feel that things would get better and better.
