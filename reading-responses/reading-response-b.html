      "The demand for symbols to be effective in a greater range of media and
        sizes requires that symbol design continues to evolve. Where once the designer
        might have exploited the increasing availbility of colour in the printing
        proces, now there is the opportunity to digitally enginner a symbol to work
        on the dynamic interfaces of mobile phones, Internet sites and 3-D virtual
        enviroments. Designingfor multilayered (build-up) or time-based (animated)
        effects has moved from a fringe requirement to the mainstream in the first
        decade of the twenty-first century."

      Q1 In the article, the use of colour in designing symbols is not much discussed.
      Only the increasing availbility of colour in the printing process is mentioned
      here. Does it mean that the design of symbols originally does not intend
      to take the use of colour into consideration? As technology evolves, the use
      of digital platform is becoming more popular, and that provides the room
      for designer to present more colour than before. Would it bring about or
      have it already broungt about the trend of using various non-basic colours,
      non-basic colours here i refer to colours not in the<a href="http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-theory-intro.htm#Color_Wheel">colour wheel.</a>

      Q2 Besides, would the use of 3-D or anitmated elements change the trend of
      'simplicity' which has been dominated the world for a while?
