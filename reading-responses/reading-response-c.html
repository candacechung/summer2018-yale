      "A collection is usually an attempt to some-
      how take hold of the world around us, to
      control at least a few of its parts. In this
      way, the wealthy collector tries to arrest
      things, to seperate them from their function,
      ultimately seperating them from a living
      world through the act of completion. An
      artist or designer, on the other hand, might
      prefer the continuity of things, or to mimic
      the precious collection by reinstalling some
      of the precariousness of life."

      Rather than describing people who tries to arrest things as greedy,
      I think it is more sacastic to describe them as 'wealthy'. It reflects how
      selfish people are, to think that they could spend the money and keep or own
      the valuable pieces with themselves rather than to share it with others.
      It also reminds me of photography, one of my interest. Maybe it is because
      we are not that rich to keep beautiful things with us, that makes photography,
      which allows us to capture the beauty, so tempting. Every one has the possesion,
      especially for things that we like. But it is important to realise that, owning
      it and seperating it from the world does not mean anything, if no one else
      could understand the value of the piece or if its beauty could no longer last.
